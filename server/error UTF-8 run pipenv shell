This system supports the C.UTF-8 locale which is recommended.
You might be able to resolve your issue by exporting the
following environment variables:

    export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
    export LANG=C.UTF-8

Click discovered that you exported a UTF-8 locale
but the locale system could not pick up from it because
it does not exist.  The exported locale is "en_US.UTF-8" but it
is not supported

chỉ cần chạy lệnh bên dưới, xong pipenv shell

export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
export LANG=C.UTF-8
